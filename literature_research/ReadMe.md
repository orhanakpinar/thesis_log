# Literature Research Container

For recording the process, I thought that it would be useful to upload the literature selection here as well.

## The process: 
Download keyword results, and then select what is related to the broader concept of social food security/food sovereignty, rural, and agricultural issues.

Second, I will classify further by topic specialization. Then select the articles related to land use and agricultural policy issues.

Later, I will focus on Turkey's research issues for connecting with the global. 

As this is my very first exploratory research on the food security and sovereignty topic, I am taking notes at random inside the docs.

Finally, I hope to derive a puzzle from these articles.


### Documents
1. In the first part, I started with global research. The file is "food_sovereignty_scopus_13Jun2024.xlsx" containing 1502 abstracts. Tagged 1170 articles, read in chronological order

Keyword query, from Scopus, results from 13 June 2024:
  
  TITLE-ABS-KEY ( food AND sovereignty ) AND PUBYEAR > 1997 AND PUBYEAR < 2025 AND ( LIMIT-TO ( DOCTYPE , "ar" ) ) AND ( LIMIT-TO ( LANGUAGE , "English" ) ) AND ( LIMIT-TO ( SRCTYPE , "j" ) )

2. Second document is from Turkey, using "agricultural" and "rural", saved as
"Türkiye_tarımsalVEkırsal_dergipark_27Jun2024.xlsx", containing 481 results, some of are exported as empty rows from the source.

Keyword query, from Dergipark, results from 27 June 2024:

(abstract: "tarımsal" AND abstract: "kırsal" ) AND (pubyear: (>=1940))

3. Started working on the creation of a Food Sovereignty Index. I am not not creating an export, literature is very sparse.

   Keyword quey, fro m Scopus, results from 06 Temmuz 2024 == 51 Research results:

   TITLE-ABS-KEY ( food AND sovereignty AND index )
