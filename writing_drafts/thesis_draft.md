##### Pre-Abstract: In this research, I aim to develop a Food Sovereignty Index (FSOI) to measure the social vulnerability aspect of food security in agriculture and food networks. In particular, rural transformation reveals the change in the relationship of peasants with the land. In the global context, food is easily accessible via hyperfast international trade. Food security is a deductive approach in response to the biological and environmental aspects of the agri-food systems. Here, I will create a ground-based approach index using the variables mentioned in historical and regional research. Globally referenced variables will be used after a comparison with domestic variables. I will apply the Food Sovereignty Index for the year 2012, to Turkey's Law No. 6360, the "Metropolitan Law" (Büyükşehir Yasası), which represents a control variable for measuring the change of food sovereignty, with respect to food security.

# Outline

## Literature Research
The literature research process follows a procedural method. Firstly, the articles are collected from academic indexes (Scopus at the moment) using the keywords "food sovereignty" and selected 1170 articles out of 1503, regarding their sociological aspect. Later, using selected prefixes, I eliminated 6 topics that are "indigenous and migrants", "gender", "urban", "education and academic", "global", "sea and land animals", and "Covid-19". In the final part, I defined topics for representing rural life, agri-food networks, and socio-political access.

The detailed target topics are shown in the literature_annotation notebook.
